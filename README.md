### Hi there 👋

Data Analyst with a proven ability to focus on the details in collaborative environments. Confidently led a team of 5 consultants while heavily contributing to 4 data science projects over 6 months. My combined passion for learning and data science pushed me to attend an intensive 1,000+ hour data analytics bootcamp where I learned advanced data ETL, programming, visualization, and statistics while also sharpening existing skills. As a strategy consultant, I identified bottlenecks in a non-profit’s outreach campaign and devised a campaign that piqued the interest of 17 C-level executives that 8.5 X’d the non-profit organization’s corporate partnerships. I’m excited to apply my passion for data science towards the collaborative efforts of a team focused on insightful, high-quality data analytics and visualizations.
